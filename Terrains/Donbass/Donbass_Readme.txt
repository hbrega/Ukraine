Donbass Beta 0.30
*****************************************************
Southern Ukraine and Crimean Peninsula Terrain


THIS IS STILL  A BETA VERSION!!!!
============================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This terrain is written for SF2E. It works well with SF2NA.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I. Short description:

The south and the east of the Ukraine are battlegrounds in mid 2022. At the moment nobody knows how the war will end.

This terrain covers the most parts of the Ukraine and some parts of the Russian Federation. But only the southern war theater and the crimean peninsula are included in this terrain so far. Airfields and some other target areas are placed on the map. Further improvements will come.
I made the airfields in their shape as realistic as possible. Only 3 airfields are more or less freestyle.

At the moment the terrain is made for scenarios around the Crimean peninsula. Offensive operations are more focused for the ukrainian side. In ukrainian strike missions you can fly against airfields, factories, depots, Sewastopol harbour and support facilities and a dense SAM network. 
For the russian side you can only fly against enemy airfields.
At the moment possible mission types are:  Sweep, CAP, Escort, Intercept, Recon, Strike and SEAD missions. 

The terrain is set as NavalMap=FALSE, but it is prepared for NavalMap=TRUE. If you use SF2NA as basic game you may change the setting, so that carrier vs carrier operations will be possible.

II. INSTALLATION: 

To run this terrain you need SF2NorthAtlantic or SF2 Israel or SF2 Europe. 


Unzip all files into your saved game folder ...ThirdWire\StrikeFighters2XXXX


Thats it.


If you have SF2Europe installed you must do nothing more.
If you miss SF2E and have SF2Israel you must open file

Donbass.ini

with Notepad editor and look for the lines:

//CatFile=..\IsraelME\IsraelME.cat
CatFile=..\GermanyCE\GermanyCE.cat

change the entry into:

CatFile=..\IsraelME\IsraelME.cat
//CatFile=..\GermanyCE\GermanyCE.cat


save the file
