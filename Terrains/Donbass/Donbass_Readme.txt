Donbass Beta 0.1
*****************************************************
Southern Ukraine and Crimean Peninsula Terrain


THIS IS STILL  A VERY EARLY BETA VERSION!!!!
=======================================
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This terrain is written for SF2E. It works well with SF2NA.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I. Short description:

The south and the east of the Ukraine are battlegrounds in mid 2022. At the moment nobody knows how the war will end.
This terrain covers the most parts of the Ukraine and some parts of the Russian Federation. But only the southern war theater and the crimean peninsula are included in this terrain so far. Airfields and some other target areas are placed on the map. Further improvements will come.
I made the ukrainian airfields in their shape as realistic as possible. The russian airfields are mostly placeholders.

At the moment only an airfield vs airfield scenario is possible to play. You can already fly Sweep, CAP, Escort, Intercept, Recon, Strike and SEAD missions. There is one problem, that the game engine during Strike missions only select runways as target. I hope, that i can solve this problem in a future update.

The terrain is set as NavalMap=FALSE, but it is prepared for NavalMap=TRUE. If you use SF2NA as basic game you may change the setting, so that carrier vs carrier operations will be possible.

II. INSTALLATION: 

To run this terrain you need SF2NorthAtlantic or SF2 Israel or SF2 Europe. 


Unzip all files into your saved game folder ...ThirdWire\StrikeFighters2XXXX


Thats it.


If you have SF2Europe installed you must do nothing more.
If you miss SF2E and have SF2Israel you must open file

Donbass.ini

with Notepad editor and look for the lines:

//CatFile=..\IsraelME\IsraelME.cat
CatFile=..\GermanyCE\GermanyCE.cat

change the entry into:

CatFile=..\IsraelME\IsraelME.cat
//CatFile=..\GermanyCE\GermanyCE.cat


save the file
