***Effects Pack #3 by Deuces***
*********12/25/2005************
===============================

===============================
*Notes
===============================
 This effects pack contains all of the effects I've done to date with the exception of the nuke effect. I may revise that at a later time.
 If you have any of my previous effects installed, allow the new files to overwrite any of the files in the effects folder that were done by me. It will also update the CountermeasureEffect.ini as I have updated the Flare effect.

 These effects have been tested on my machine and one other so if you find your framerate unsatisfactory, then restore your effects folder from your backup, see below, or simply delete the offending ini from the effects folder.

 Please contact me prior to using any of the files contained for any other project. You all know I will give my blessing but it's just the right thing to do. 
 You are free to tweak the effects to your liking. Any credits would be appreciated as these take a very long time to create and test.

===============================
*Pre-Install
===============================

BACKUP YOUR EFFECTS FOLDER!!!!!

My standard disclaimer--If you screw something up, don't come cryin to me about it.

===============================
*Installation
===============================
It doesn't get any easier. 
-Once you've backed up your Effects folder 
-Extract all of the files in the zip to the Strategy First/Strike Fighters/Effects folder.
-If asked to overwrite an existing file, say "YES".
-One glitch I've found and will correct once indetified--You will need to place a copy of the Explosion1, Fire1, and Smoke tga in your Strategy First/Strike Fighters/Flight folder. This is something that popped up after the last patch and will be corrected.
-That's it, done.
-This will work in WOV as well. Follow the same process only use the Wings Over Vietnam Effects folder.

==============================
Finally
==============================
Thanks to the TK for a fine open sim to allow these mods to be made and to the community for the continued support.
Special thanks to KillerBee for testing all of these out for me.

Hope you all enjoy
