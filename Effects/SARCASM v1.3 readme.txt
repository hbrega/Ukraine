ORIGINAL v1.0 README:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tiny mod is my modification of stock post-June11 environmentsystem.ini, that I created in spare time for own enjoyment. Incorporated are several tweaks and graphics files I created to slightly change the looks and feel of the SF2 series environment.

Changes include:

New, light blue sky colour for midday
New, more purple, cinematic sky colours for sunrise/sunset
Slightly modified fog colours
Reduced sky glow for sunrise/sunset
New, slighly bigger sun with new sun graphics
New sun flare
New clouds sizes and graphics for all weather types
Now clear weather has some small fluffy clouds too
New, bigger lens flares with new graphics
Slightly bigger Moon
New stars graphics
New, stronger base winds and gusts for more dramatic smoke columns etc.
Other tiny changes

Please note: as of Expansion Pack 2, clouds height seems to be locked at specific untweakable altitude (=> ~10000 feet).
I, aswell as others, tried various settings, even negative cloud base height values to no luck.
