Scud launcher 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Installation is a 2 part process

First part is to drop the entire ScudLauncher folder into your GroundObject folder . 

Second part is to add the missile for the launcher . This is done in the usual way by adding all the files from the Missile folder to your Weapons folder then the new weapon data to your WEAPONDATA.ini file located in the weapons folder . Next use the weapons editor to open and save the new addition , Thats it . hope you all find some use for this little mod .

I obide by the usual rules regarding usage permissions of other peoples works so if anyone woud like to use this mod in anything else in the future i would appreciate a quick PM on the forums , not that i would have a problem it's more to keep me in the loop than anything else . 

Thanks to all at CombatAce for allowing me to upload this file , TK for the TW series of games and anyone who helps me out on the forums . 

Cheers .
