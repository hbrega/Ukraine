North Dakota Texaco tanker v1.0 for SF2

This is an attempt at making a better-looking target as compared to the stock cargoship. I think this looks better.

Be advised this uses normalmapping and is thus incompatible with versions of the game earlier than february 2010. Works fine in DX9 however though you'll not see any per-pixel lighting.

Known Issues:

Destroyed model absolutely refuses to show up ingame. However I've included the lod file so any enterprising souls can give it a go.
