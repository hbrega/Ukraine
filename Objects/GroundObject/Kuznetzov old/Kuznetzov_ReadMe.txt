HMS Vindictive - Furious Class fleet aircraft carrier

Model/textures by Hinchinbrooke

Inspired by The Wrench's Royal Navy Tomcat repaint, the ship is very loosely based on CVA-01, cancelled in the 1960's.


1.  Place the "Vindictive" folder into the "Objects" directory within SF.
2.  Place the "Vindictive_data.ini" file into the "Objects" directory within SF.
3.  Add these lines to the "groundobjectdata.ini" file (which needs to be extracted, using the extracting gizmo):

	[Objectxxx]........"xxx" being the next number in sequence
	ObjectName=Vindictive
	ObjectFullName=HMS Vindictive
	ObjectDataFile=Vindictive_data.ini

	(see also Capun's visual guide on installation, posted on the SimHQ forum).
