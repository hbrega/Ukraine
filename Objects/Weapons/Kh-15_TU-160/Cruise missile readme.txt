These models are not to be used in any commercial or for-profit packages. They may, however, be used in any freeware mod. 


This package includes 97 third-party weapons which I have updated to SF2:NA standards, adjusting for real-world specifications where possible. These include every single cruise missile that I have in my collection, plus a few exotic variants of them (i.e. Soviet anti-radiation versions) which I've tweaked for consistency.

Some of the weapons are by me, but the vast majority were from the SF2 Ordnance Shop pack. Kudos and credits to the original modellers. If you made one of these items and would like individual credit, do not hesitate to contact me. And if you have more cruise missiles or updated models for existing ones, please let me know right away.

Note: These weapons now use the new cruise missile data type from SF2:NA, so they will NOT work with earlier versions of the game.


Installation (SF2): 

Extract the weapons into your Weapons directory, overwrite when necessary.
