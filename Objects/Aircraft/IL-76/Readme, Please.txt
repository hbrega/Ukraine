The Ilyushin Il-76 (Russian: Илью́шин Ил-76; NATO reporting name: Candid) is a multi-purpose
four-engine turbofan strategic airlifter designed by the Soviet Union's Ilyushin design bureau.
It was first planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a replacement for the Antonov An-12.

the Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa.
