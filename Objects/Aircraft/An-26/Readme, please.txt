After successful operations of the An-24T tactical transport in austere locations,
interest in a version with a retractable cargo ramp increased. Initial studies for
he retractable ramp were carried out as part of the projected An-40 medium transport.
When given the go-ahead for the An-26 in March 1968, the Antonov OKB adapted the ramp
design of the An-40 to the An-24 fuselage, resulting in the An-26. Particular attention
was given to the military mission, and the majority of early An-26 production was
delivered to the VTA (voyenno-transportnaya aviatsiya).
Using the majority of the An-24 airframe, with its high-set cantilevered wings, twin 
turboprops and stalky main undercarriage, the An-26 included military equipment, such
as tip-up paratroop canvas seats, an overhead traveling hoist, bulged observation windows
and parachute static line attachment cables. The An-26 made its public debut at the 27th
Paris Air Show at Le Bourget where the second prototype, CCCP-26184 (c/n00202), was shown
in the static aircraft park.
The An-26 is also manufactured without a license agreement in China by the Xian Aircraft
factory as the Y-14, later changed to be included in the Xian Y7 series
